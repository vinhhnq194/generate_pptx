                            <p>Tigo Chad’s mobile money service offered standard P2P transfers and bill payments. The
                                company sought to deepen usage by addressing the local savings habit of <strong>
                                <em>Paaré</em></strong> (informal savings groups).</p>

                            <p>Launched <strong>"Tigo Cash Paaré"</strong> in 2015, a mobile-enabled group savings
                                account. Features included shared wallets with multiple contributors, configurable
                                plans, and designated approval for withdrawals. Tigo also incentivized saving by
                                contributing a small bonus to the group’s pot.</p>

                                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Scaled to over 53,000 savings groups by the end of 2016.</li>
                                <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Drove a sharp increase in cash-in transactions and deposit
                                    volumes on the platform.</li>
                                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Group wallets are "stickier" than individual wallets,
                                    creating a competitive moat and ensuring long-term use.</li>

                            <p>Users appreciated the convenience, security, and transparency of the digital solution. The
                                ability for remote members to participate was transformative, and the Tigo bonus was a
                                powerful incentive. The service empowered women, who often lead these groups, to gain a
                                stronger financial footing.</p>

                            <p>Tigo's strategy was to adapt its innovation to existing social practices, onboarding entire
                                groups at once instead of one user at a time. The key lesson is that enhancing what
                                people are already doing (informal savings) with technology can lead to massive user
                                acquisition, retention, and loyalty, especially in markets with strong community-based
                                financial traditions.</p>
